# HOL-Ants

This repository contains a detailed, principled model in HOL Light simulating foraging ants in an idealized environment. 

The model is designed to explore long-term dynamics based on pheromone release and tracking. 

We formally verify in HOL Light the convergence of the ant colony on the shortest path to a food source during foraging activities.
